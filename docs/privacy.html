          This Privacy Policy explains how the XTRA PR71 Router Controller app
          ("the app") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you

          pocket routers. The app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
          connected to the manufacturers of XTRA PR71 routers. We are committed
